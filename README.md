==========================

Cryptography.jl is a free Julia package of cryptographic schemes. This is intended to provide a reliable and stable base to study cryptography. It is not designed to compete in speed with other libraries, but on the contrary to facilitate the compression of the algorithms from an academic point of view. A central objective has been to provide a simple and coherent interface for similar classes of algorithms that share an abstract type in an idiomatic form for Julia.
